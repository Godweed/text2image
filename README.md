**text2image** is a small Web Application which converts any string in an abstract gradient image having as a constructor the MD5 hash of the text input, so basically it could be also described as the MD5 visualization of a string.

The project is built on JavaScript / Canvas and it has also a fallback written on PHP / GD Library for those who don't have JavaScript enabled on their browsers.
